Welcome to the interactive tutorial. 

In this step, you will learn how to run a command.

This is an example of Java:

```java
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```

Run this command to say hello:

```bash
echo "Hello World" > /tmp/output
cat /tmp/output
```

And run this to see the file system:

```bash
ls -la
```
