# Lifecycle Scripts

Turtorial allows you to define **lifecycle scripts** for each step. These scripts run automatically when you enter or leave a step.

- **`before`**: Runs when the step is loaded. Useful for setting up the environment (creating files, starting services).
- **`after`**: Runs when you navigate away from the step. Useful for cleanup.

## Try it out!

In this step, we've defined a `before` script that creates a file at `/tmp/turtorial-demo.txt`.

Verify it exists by running:

```bash
cat /tmp/turtorial-demo.txt
```

When you move to the next or previous step, the `after` script will automatically remove this file!
