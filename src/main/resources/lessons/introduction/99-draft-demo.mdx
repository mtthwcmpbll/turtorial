# Draft Step

If you are reading this, it means you have enabled `turtorial.dev-mode`!

This step is marked with `draft: true` in its frontmatter. It demonstrates how authors can hide WIP content from regular users.

To hide this step again, set `turtorial.dev-mode: false` in your `application.yml`.
