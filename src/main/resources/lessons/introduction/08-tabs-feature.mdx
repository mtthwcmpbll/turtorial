# Workspace Tabs

Turtorial now supports multiple tabs in the workspace pane! You can switch between the **Terminal** and **Browser** using the tabs at the top of the right panel, or create new ones using the `+` button.

## Browser Integration

Links in the lesson content can now open directly in a new Browser tab within the workspace.

Try it out: [Open Google](https://google.com)

## Terminal Integration

You can also run commands directly from these code blocks. Clicking "Run" will ensure a Terminal tab is open and execute the command.

```bash
echo 'Hello from a new tab!'
```
