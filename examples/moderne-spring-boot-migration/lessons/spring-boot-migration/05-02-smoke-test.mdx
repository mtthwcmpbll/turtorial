# Exercise 2: Run a Spring Boot 4 Smoke Test

Now that we are on Java 17, let's see how far the Spring Boot 4 upgrade gets. This is a "smoke test" to identify remaining blockers.

Run the upgrade recipe:

```bash
mod run $WORKSPACE --recipe io.moderne.java.spring.boot4.UpgradeSpringBoot_4_0
```

Apply the changes temporarily:

```bash
mod git apply $WORKSPACE --last-recipe-run
```
