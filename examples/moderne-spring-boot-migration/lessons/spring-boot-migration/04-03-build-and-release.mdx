# Exercise 3: Build and Release

Before proceeding, we must ensure everything builds and release the new versions. We will use the provided helper scripts.

Verify the changes with a build:

```bash
$WORKSHOP/build.sh
```

If successful, commit the changes:

```bash
mod git add $WORKSPACE --last-recipe-run
mod git commit $WORKSPACE -m "Workshop baseline: Maven, Java 8, Spring Boot 2.7" --last-recipe-run
```

Now, perform a release to update dependencies and bump versions for the next step:

```bash
$WORKSHOP/release.sh
```

Finally, rebuild the LSTs so the CLI sees the updated code state:

```bash
mod build $WORKSPACE
```
