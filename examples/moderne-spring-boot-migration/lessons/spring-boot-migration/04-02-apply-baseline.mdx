# Exercise 2: Apply the Baseline Recipe

First, let's build the LSTs for the new wave structure:

```bash
mod build $WORKSPACE
```

Now, run the baseline recipe across the entire workspace (all waves):

```bash
mod run $WORKSPACE --recipe com.example.ecom.recipe.SpringBootMigrationWorkshopBaseline
```

Apply the changes:

```bash
mod git apply $WORKSPACE --last-recipe-run
```
