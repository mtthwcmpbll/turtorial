# Preparing for Spring Boot Migration

Spring Boot migrations are rarely just a version bump. You need to understand your repositories, identify hidden dependencies, align build tooling, and plan release waves so downstream services can upgrade safely. This workshop walks you through a realistic, end-to-end prep flow using the Moderne CLI so you can move into a Spring Boot 4 migration with fewer surprises.

## Workshop Overview

In this workshop, you will:

1.  **Assess**: Run an initial migration and gather code insight data.
2.  **Plan**: Analyze dependencies and organize upgrade waves.
3.  **Baseline**: Normalize Maven, Java, and Spring Boot versions.
4.  **Smoke Test**: Upgrade to Java 17 and run a Spring Boot 4 smoke test.
5.  **Migrate**: Finish the migration in waves using custom recipes.

## Environment Setup

This tutorial runs in a pre-configured environment with the Moderne CLI (`mod`) and necessary build tools (Maven, Java).

The example repositories have been cloned into your workspace at `/home/turtorial/moderne-migration-practice` (referred to as `$WORKSHOP`).

Let's start by setting up some environment variables to make the commands easier to run.

```bash
export WORKSHOP=/home/turtorial/moderne-migration-practice
export WORKSPACE=/home/turtorial/workspaces/migration-practice-workspace
export PROJECTS=/home/turtorial/projects
```

Now, let's create our workspace directory and sync the repositories.

```bash
mkdir -p $WORKSPACE
cd $WORKSPACE

# Sync the repositories from the workshop configuration
mod git sync csv $WORKSPACE $WORKSHOP/repos.csv --with-sources
```

Verify that the repositories are synced:

```bash
ls -F $WORKSPACE
```

You should see a directory structure corresponding to the repositories.

## Build LSTs

To run recipes, we need to build Lossless Semantic Trees (LSTs) for the projects.

```bash
mod build $WORKSPACE
```

This might take a few minutes as it compiles the projects and generates the LSTs.

## Install Recipes

We'll install the necessary recipes for this workshop.

```bash
mod config recipes jar install \
  io.moderne.recipe:rewrite-spring:0.19.0 \
  org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-migrate-java:3.24.0 \
  org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-java-dependencies:1.48.0 \
  org.openrewrite:rewrite-java:8.69.0 \
  org.openrewrite:rewrite-maven:8.69.0 \
  io.moderne.recipe:rewrite-devcenter:1.13.1 \
  org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-spring:6.21.0 \
  org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-testing-frameworks:3.24.0
```

Now you are ready to start the assessment!
