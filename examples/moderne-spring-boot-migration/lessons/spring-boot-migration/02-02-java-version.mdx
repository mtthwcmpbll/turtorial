# Exercise 2: Identify Java Version Usage

Let's see what Java versions are currently in use across the repositories.

```bash
mod run $WORKSPACE --recipe org.openrewrite.java.migrate.search.PlanJavaMigration --dry-run
```

To see the data table produced by this recipe:

```bash
mod study $WORKSPACE --last-recipe-run --data-table org.openrewrite.java.migrate.table.JavaVersionMigrationPlan
```

You should see that most projects are on Java 8.
