# Exercise 1: Upgrade to Java 17

In this module, you will raise the Java baseline to 17 and run a controlled Spring Boot 4 upgrade to identify any remaining blockers.

Spring Boot 3+ (and 4) requires Java 17 or higher. So, let's upgrade all repositories to Java 17 first.

Run the `UpgradeToJava17` recipe:

```bash
mod run $WORKSPACE --recipe org.openrewrite.java.migrate.UpgradeToJava17
```

Apply the changes:

```bash
mod git apply $WORKSPACE --last-recipe-run
```

Now, build and commit the changes:

```bash
$WORKSHOP/build.sh
mod git add $WORKSPACE --last-recipe-run
mod git commit $WORKSPACE -m "Upgrade to Java 17" --last-recipe-run
```

And rebuild the LSTs:

```bash
mod build $WORKSPACE
```
