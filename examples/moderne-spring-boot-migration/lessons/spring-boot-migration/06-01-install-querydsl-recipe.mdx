# Exercise 1: Install the QueryDSL Recipe

In this module, you will install a custom recipe to handle the QueryDSL issues, build a composite upgrade recipe, and upgrade each wave of repositories to Spring Boot 4.

We need a custom recipe to rename packages and update dependencies for QueryDSL.

Clone the custom recipe repository:

```bash
cd $PROJECTS
git clone https://github.com/modernetraining/rewrite-querydsl.git
```

Build and install it locally:

```bash
cd rewrite-querydsl
mvn clean install
mod config recipes jar install org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-querydsl:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT
```
