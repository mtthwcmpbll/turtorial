# Exercise 4: Upgrade Wave 1

Now repeat for Wave 1:

```bash
mod run $WORKSPACE/Wave1 --recipe org.openrewrite.recipe.querydsl.CustomUpgradeSpringBoot_4_0
```

Apply changes:

```bash
mod git apply $WORKSPACE/Wave1 --last-recipe-run
```

Build and release Wave 1:

```bash
$WORKSHOP/build.sh 1
$WORKSHOP/release.sh 1
```

You can continue this process for Wave 2 and Wave 3 to complete the migration across all repositories.
