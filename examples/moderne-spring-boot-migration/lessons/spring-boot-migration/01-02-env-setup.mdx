# Environment Setup

This tutorial runs in a pre-configured environment with the Moderne CLI (`mod`) and necessary build tools (Maven, Java).

The example repositories have been cloned into your workspace at `/home/turtorial/moderne-migration-practice` (referred to as `$WORKSHOP`).

Let's start by setting up some environment variables to make the commands easier to run.

```bash
export WORKSHOP=/home/turtorial/moderne-migration-practice
export WORKSPACE=/home/turtorial/workspaces/migration-practice-workspace
export PROJECTS=/home/turtorial/projects
```

Now, let's create our workspace directory and sync the repositories.

```bash
mkdir -p $WORKSPACE
cd $WORKSPACE

# Sync the repositories from the workshop configuration
mod git sync csv $WORKSPACE $WORKSHOP/repos.csv --with-sources
```

Verify that the repositories are synced:

```bash
ls -F $WORKSPACE
```

You should see a directory structure corresponding to the repositories.
