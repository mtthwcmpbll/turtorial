# Exercise 1: Run the Full Migration Recipe (Dry Run)

In this module, you will run the Spring Boot 4 migration recipe to find the biggest risks and blockers. The idea is to see what breaks before investing time in fixes.

First, let's run a "dry run" of the full Spring Boot 4 migration recipe. This will not modify the code but will identify what changes would be made and what errors might occur.

```bash
mod run $WORKSPACE --recipe io.moderne.java.spring.boot4.UpgradeSpringBoot_4_0 --dry-run
```

Review the output. You might see warnings or errors related to missing types or compilation failures. This is expected!

Specifically, look for errors related to `QueryDSL` (generated code issues) or missing dependencies.
