# Exercise 5: Refresh DevCenter

After upgrading waves, you can generate a DevCenter dashboard to visualize the progress.

First, rebuild LSTs:

```bash
mod build $WORKSPACE
```

Run the `DevCenterStarter` recipe:

```bash
mod run $WORKSPACE --recipe io.moderne.devcenter.DevCenterStarter
```

Generate the DevCenter dashboard:

```bash
mod devcenter $WORKSPACE --last-recipe-run
```

This will produce an HTML file you can open to see the updated status of your repositories.
