# Exercise 1: Generate Dependency Data

In this module, you'll move from assessment to planning. You will group repositories into “waves” based on dependencies and upgrade them in order.

First, we need to install a recipe that analyzes dependencies to create a wave plan.

Clone the `Release-Train-Metro-Plan` repository:

```bash
mkdir -p $PROJECTS
cd $PROJECTS
git clone https://github.com/MBoegers/Release-Train-Metro-Plan.git
```

Install the recipe artifact locally:

```bash
mod config recipes jar install dev.mboegie.rewrite:release-train-metro-plan:RELEASE
```

Now, run the recipe on your workspace:

```bash
mod run $WORKSPACE --recipe dev.mboegie.rewrite.releasemetro.ReleaseMetroPlan --parallel
```

This generates several data tables (e.g., `ParentRelationships`, `ProjectCoordinates`) that can be used to visualize the dependency graph.

In a real-world scenario, you would export these tables and use a tool (like a Jupyter notebook) to generate a "metro map" of your upgrade waves. For this workshop, we have pre-calculated the waves for you.
