# Exercise 3: Build Waves (Expect Failure)

Let's try to build Wave 0 and Wave 1.

```bash
$WORKSHOP/build.sh 0
```

Wave 0 (common libraries) should build successfully.

```bash
$WORKSHOP/build.sh 1
```

Wave 1 is expected to fail. Why? Because of QueryDSL issues! We'll fix this in the next module.
