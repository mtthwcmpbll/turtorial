# Exercise 2: Organize Workspace by Wave

Based on the dependency analysis, we have identified the following waves:

*   **Wave 0**: Independent repositories (libraries).
*   **Wave 1**: Services depending only on Wave 0.
*   **Wave 2**: Services depending on Wave 1.
*   **Wave 3**: Services depending on Wave 2.

We will use a special `repos-waves.csv` file that groups the repositories into these waves. This allows us to target specific waves with our recipes.

Sync the repositories using the wave-aware CSV:

```bash
mod git sync csv $WORKSPACE $WORKSHOP/repos-waves.csv --with-sources
```

If prompted to replace the existing organization, confirm with `Y`.

Now, verify the new structure:

```bash
ls -F $WORKSPACE
```

You should see directories like `Wave0`, `Wave1`, etc. This structure is critical for running wave-based migrations.
