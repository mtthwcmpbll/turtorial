# Module 1: Migration Assessment

In this module, you will run the Spring Boot 4 migration recipe to find the biggest risks and blockers. The idea is to see what breaks before investing time in fixes.

## Exercise 1: Run the Full Migration Recipe (Dry Run)

First, let's run a "dry run" of the full Spring Boot 4 migration recipe. This will not modify the code but will identify what changes would be made and what errors might occur.

```bash
mod run $WORKSPACE --recipe io.moderne.java.spring.boot4.UpgradeSpringBoot_4_0 --dry-run
```

Review the output. You might see warnings or errors related to missing types or compilation failures. This is expected!

Specifically, look for errors related to `QueryDSL` (generated code issues) or missing dependencies.

## Exercise 2: Identify Java Version Usage

Let's see what Java versions are currently in use across the repositories.

```bash
mod run $WORKSPACE --recipe org.openrewrite.java.migrate.search.PlanJavaMigration --dry-run
```

To see the data table produced by this recipe:

```bash
mod study $WORKSPACE --last-recipe-run --data-table org.openrewrite.java.migrate.table.JavaVersionMigrationPlan
```

You should see that most projects are on Java 8.

## Exercise 3: Inspect Spring Boot Versions

Now, let's find out which Spring Boot versions are currently used.

```bash
mod run $WORKSPACE --recipe org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.DependencyInsight --dry-run \
  --recipe-option groupPattern=org.springframework.boot \
  --recipe-option artifactPattern=* \
  --recipe-option scope=runtime
```

Check the results:

```bash
mod study $WORKSPACE --last-recipe-run --data-table org.openrewrite.maven.table.DependenciesInUse
```

## Exercise 4: Find `javax.*` Usage

Spring Boot 3+ (and thus 4) moves from `javax.*` to `jakarta.*`. High usage of `javax.*` means more work.

```bash
mod run $WORKSPACE --recipe org.openrewrite.java.search.FindTypes --dry-run \
  --recipe-option fullyQualifiedTypeName=javax..*
```

Check the results:

```bash
mod study $WORKSPACE --last-recipe-run --data-table org.openrewrite.java.search.TypeUses
```

## Exercise 5: Locate Code Generators (QueryDSL)

Code generators like QueryDSL can be major blockers. Let's find where they are used.

```bash
mod run $WORKSPACE --recipe org.openrewrite.maven.search.FindPlugin --dry-run \
  --recipe-option groupId=com.mysema.maven \
  --recipe-option artifactId=apt-maven-plugin
```

Check the results:

```bash
mod study $WORKSPACE --last-recipe-run --data-table org.openrewrite.maven.table.SearchResults
```

You should see usage in several services.

**Quiz**

Why is it important to run a dry run and code insight recipes before starting the actual migration?

1.  To generate more code.
2.  To identify blockers, dependencies, and plan the migration strategy.
3.  To fix bugs automatically without checking.
4.  To update the Java version immediately.

**Correct Answer**: 2
