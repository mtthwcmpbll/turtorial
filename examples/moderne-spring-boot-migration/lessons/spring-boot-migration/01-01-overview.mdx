# Preparing for Spring Boot Migration

Spring Boot migrations are rarely just a version bump. You need to understand your repositories, identify hidden dependencies, align build tooling, and plan release waves so downstream services can upgrade safely. This workshop walks you through a realistic, end-to-end prep flow using the Moderne CLI so you can move into a Spring Boot 4 migration with fewer surprises.

## Workshop Overview

In this workshop, you will:

1.  **Assess**: Run an initial migration and gather code insight data.
2.  **Plan**: Analyze dependencies and organize upgrade waves.
3.  **Baseline**: Normalize Maven, Java, and Spring Boot versions.
4.  **Smoke Test**: Upgrade to Java 17 and run a Spring Boot 4 smoke test.
5.  **Migrate**: Finish the migration in waves using custom recipes.
